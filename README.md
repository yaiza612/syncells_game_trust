# SynCells Game Trust
Simulation of a synthetic community of cells playing the game of trust


## Graphical Description of the model

A: Synthetic Community of five cells playing a game of trust. Each cell produces a QS (quorum signal) but requires the neighbor's QS as well to activate the regulator that allows the transcription of proteins which each cell needs to survive and reproduce. Therefore, in this community every cell share the QS with their neighbor cell. Nevertheless, sometimes some cells decide being selfish to prosper. B: Mechanism's transcription of the proteins needed for survival and reproduction. Represent an AND GATE, without the five different types of QS, the cell cannot transcribe the proteins.


## Pricipal Output of the Simulation

In this simulation, the user can see the result of the interactions given the desired parameters.
